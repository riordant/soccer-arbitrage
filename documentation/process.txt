rules:

    Woman's games: process client side. if game found, remove woman string section, pass "WOMEN" as special, search without, and append after.
    Reserves: process client side: replace with "Res.". no need to pass as special
    underage: same as woman's.
    
soccerway doesn't have EVERYTHING - ie. the lowest level of the norwegian league (prob equivalent to Crossabeg in fairness).
in the future you could optimise the search so that when nothing is returned to try other search sites, eg fussball wettpoint contains
a lot of lower leagues.

right so what needs to be done -
    implement extra part of google package (ie. add support for "fussball wettpoint" results)
    remove SC/FC/CD from searches.
    implement the function with each bookie - observe specials in each, process, and make the query

- search full match with date as follows: D M* YYYY and soccerway
- get each result in turn
- split title by " - "
- cycle through each part of that list
- get first element that contains " vs. " or " vs "
- break.

- I think if it's a live game you gave to get it from the body of the first result with "2:00".

- ok so soccerportal does not seem to have all games.
- store the site you got it from (as "source") and ensure that the other bookiematches have the same source.

- if theres no soccerway results on the page - look for paddypower result. (I think this is just for certain in-play
  games). get the title and split by " Betting Odds". store source as PP.
  
  MAKE SURE "vs." is in the query, not "v".
  
  
For special games (not incl. underage) - search without special, then append whatever the special is after.
